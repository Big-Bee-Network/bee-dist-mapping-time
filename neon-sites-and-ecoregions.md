title: Ecoregion & Neon Site Sampling Scope
---

Here I am outlining the visualizations to illustrate potential site selection for the pollen project. I'll start with a brief introduction into the sites of interest:

This figure represents the the level 3 North American ecoregions containing NEON sites. There are a total of [27 ecoregions](https://github.com/jtmiller28/pollen-project-mapping/blob/main/processed-data/shape-outputs/ecoregions/na-lvl3-ecoregions-w-neon-sites.txt) containing the [44 NEON terrestrial sites](https://github.com/jtmiller28/pollen-project-mapping/blob/main/processed-data/shape-outputs/neon-sites/neon_sites_in_lvl3NAregions.txt) that applies to the continental extent of North America.
